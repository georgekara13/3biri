                                         --3biri---

A simple c program that takes an input txt file,tokenizes the input and puts it in a circular linked list.

3biri is a hot tempered individual and can be really mean to strangers.Please do not get offended. :)

What can 3biri understand:

read this >inputfile.txt -3biri reads the concepts and the sentences of the file and memorize them in his circular list
(You can use your files,but it has to be written in a similar fashion to inputfile.txt.It is important for proper tokenizing.Don't forget to set the name of your file "inputfile.txt")

learn this > concept:sentence  -3biri can save to his list a single concept followed by the meaning of that concept.
(for example: learn this > Internet:something that will make you smart or stupid.) 

forget this > concept -3biri will match the concept and forget about it.
(You can delete all concepts starting with a certain set of letters  if you want.For example forget this > Ar will result in forgeting about all the concepts starting with Ar)

What is the meaning of Life,The universe, and Everything?
3biri will give you a wise answer.
Try to answer "What do you know about?" or "What do you talk about?" and see what happens.

"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"
You farewell 3biri,and you force him to create a txt outputfile,logging the whole conversation.
